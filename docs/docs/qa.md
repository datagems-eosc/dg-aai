# Quality Assurance

Key aspects of the Quality Assurance checklist that DataGEMS services must pass have been defined in the processes and documents governing the platform development and quality assurance. 

For the case of DataGEMS AAI we rely on the the [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) Identity nd Access Management solution which is a well established and widely used [open source](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak) project.

In the context of DataGEMS we apply the needed configuration utilizing the available features in Keycloak without any customizations that would jeopartize the security and offered service quality.
